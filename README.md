For this project (done as part of The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS Course), I needed to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

While not required for the project, I tried to also provide a good user experience for those using the form. Try using (and abusing) it to see what it's like! 

I also tried to make the page responsive and it should hopefully work OK on mobile or tablet (in addition to working fine on desktop). I don't expect it to be very accessible though (I will be covering accessible design in a later course).

At the time of writing, the page will not work properly in Firefox. I believe that this is due to the lack of support in Firefox for the :has() pseudo-class. The page didn't work properly in Firefox even after enabling :has() via the preferences.

The page can be viewed via the following link: https://rednaxelam.github.io/sign-up-form/.
